For example for the fs module:\n\n````javascript\n/**\n BEGIN_NODE_INCLUDE\n var fs = require('fs');\n END_NODE_INCLUDE\n */\n````\n\n**NOTE:** This comment on its own does nothing. But if you stick to the template, that is including the fs module exactly\nthe same way naming it also \"fs\", the compiler will know how to handle the module and its subcomponents. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// This is bad:\nvar EventEmitter = require(\"events\").EventEmitter;\n\n// This is good:\nvar events = require(\"events\");\nvar EventEmitter = events.EventEmitter;\n```\n\nIf a file requires a dependency, it is named in the `@fileoverview` declaration. You should then include the dependency\nin your compile step, too.\n\nTesting [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dcodeIO/node.js-closure-compiler-externs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dcodeIO/node.js-closure-compiler-externs)\n-------\nExterns are automatically syntax-validated through a [ClosureCompiler.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ClosureCompiler.js)\ntest run. This does not imply that the extern is complete or does actually represent the underlying API (but it should).\n\nUsage with ClosureCompiler.js\n-----------------------------\n[ClosureCompiler.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ClosureCompiler.js) depends on an npm distribution of this repository.\nAs a result, specifiying `--externs=node` automatically includes all node.js specific externs in your compile step. If\nyou are using non-core modules, you may still need [additional externs](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ClosureCompiler.js#externs-for-advanced_optimizations)\nfor these.\n\nDownloads\n---------\n* [ZIP-Archive](https://github.com/dcodeIO/node.js-closure-compiler-externs/archive/master.zip)\n* [Tarball](https://github.com/dcodeIO/node.js-closure-compiler-externs/tarball/master)\n\nLicense\n-------\nApache License, Version 2.0 - http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\n\nThis repository is not officially supported by Google, Joyent or individual module authors.
